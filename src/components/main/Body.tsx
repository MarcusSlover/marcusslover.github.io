            Hi, I'm Marcus and I live in Warsaw.
            <br/>
            I am 18 years old and coding is my true passion.
            <br/>
            My favorite programming languages are:
            Java, Kotlin, TypeScript, and JavaScript.

            <TextBox id={"about-box-general"}>
                So, how did I learn programming? Well, that's a long story.
                My "coding" journey started at the age of eight.
                I was introduced to Scratch by my local school teachers; it allowed me to
                fulfil part of my creativity and helped me making a step into the "world" of programming.

            <TextBox id={"about-box-cpp"}>
                Surprisingly, as I moved on I started watching C++ tutorials.
                At the time, I was creating simple programs that would calculate or solve
                certain problems. Sadly, since then I haven't felt in "love" with that language at all...

        <TextHeader id={"creations"}
                    title={"My Creations"}

            Pretty much most of my creations have to do something with Minecraft.
            I absolutely love developing Minecraft plugins. Once, I even created my fully custom network!
            There probably are even some YouTube videos about SloverTeam Network.
